NCSA - Nagios Service Check Acceptor
NRPE - Nagios Remote Plugin Executor

Steps for setting up Nagios:

0. Create nagios user:

   sudo useradd nagios

00. Create nagios group:

   groupadd nagcmd

1. Enable external commands:

	vim /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg

	Set check_external_comamnds to 1

=======================================================================================================

Nagios directories:

	-- Debian/Ubuntu
	/etc/nagios-plugins	- Customizable scripts used for monitoring
	/etc/nagios3		- Configuration files to add hosts, services,
						  define checks and timers
	/etc/nagios 		- NRPE configurations on remote host
	/usr/lib/nagios/plugins - Executable binary files used for monitoring
	/etc/nagios3/httpasswd.users
		To add a user:
		htpasswd /etc/nagios3/htpasswd.users username
	/var/lib/nagios - contains SMTP messages sent for checks

How to install NRPE server:
apt-get install nagios-nrpe-plugin nagios-nrpe-server

Two syntaxes in which send_nsca can send data - service-based and host-based:
	Service Checks:
	<host_name>[tab]<svc_description>[tab]<return_code>[tab]<plugin_output>[newline]

	Host Checks:
	<host_name>[tab]<return_code>[tab]<plugin_output>[newline]

=======================================================================================================

We can have Nagios without the CGI interface.

We can use # and ; for comments

log_file - path to logfile. This directive needs to be the  first one to be setup
cfg_file - specify an object file; We can specify multiple cfg_file directives
cfg_dir - specify a directory with configuration files for Nagios to process; only files with .cfg extension will be parsed.  Additionally, Nagios will 		recursively process all config files in subdirectories of the directory you specify here. We can have multiple cfg_dir directories
object_cache_file - a cached copy of object definitions, that is used by the CGI scripts
precached_object_file - This directive is used to specify a file in which a pre-processed, pre-cached copy of object definitions should be stored.
resource_file - a file that contains $USERn$ user-defined macros. They are useful for storing usernames, passwords and directory paths.
temp_file - temporary file that Nagios generates periodically before updating data. The file is deleted when it is no longer needed.
temp_path - path where temporary files, created by Nagios are stored
status_file - This is the file that Nagios uses to store the current status, comment, and downtime information. This file is used by the CGIs so that 			current monitoring status can be reported via a web interface. The CGIs must have read access to this file in order to function properly. This 			file is deleted every time Nagios stops and recreated when it starts. 
nagios_user - the user with which the nagios process is run
nagios_group - the group with which the nagios porcess is run
status_update_interval - the time in second during which nagios will update status in the status file. The minimal level is 1
enable_notifications - This option determines whether or not Nagios will send out notifications when it initially (re)starts.
execute_service_checks - This option determines whether or not Nagios will execute service checks when it initially (re)starts.  This option is most 		often used when configuring backup monitoring servers, as described in the documentation on redundancy, or when setting up a distributed monitoring 	environment.
accept_passive_service_checks - This option determines whether or not Nagios will accept passive service checks when it initially (re)starts.

enable_event_handlers - This option determines whether or not Nagios will run event handlers when it initially (re)starts. If this option is disabled, Nagios will not run any host or service event handlers.

log_rotation_method - specify log rotation period

	d - daily
	h - hourly
	n - none (disable log rotation)
	w - weekly
	m - monthly

log_archive_path - path to directory where archives of rotated logs will be stored (ignored if we disable log rotation)
check_for_updates - check for nagios updates
lock_file - path to lock file in case Nagios run as a daemon
retain_state_information - This option determines whether or not Nagios will retain state information for hosts and services between program restarts. 	 	If you enable this option, you should supply a value for the state_retention_file variable.
state_retention_file - the file where nagios stores status, downtime and comment information before it shuts down
use_syslog - setup Nagios to use the syslog facility for logging

sanity check - configuration status check
