identifiers - class/variable/object names

Scalar data types are the ones that have a single value.
Collections/complex data types are those with multiple valies - e.g. arrays, objects, hashes.

A pointer is an intiger that holds a memory address!!!

Expressions contain identifiers, literals and operators and can
amount to a value.
Statements are build up of expressions.
Expressions can be and are parts of statements.

Types of control statemens:

- Conditional - if/else, unless
- Iterative - e.g. a loop
- Jumping - e.g. goto, break, continue

In C programming language terminology, a translation unit is the
ultimate input to a C compiler from which an object file is generated.

Предикатна функция - функция, която връща стойност от булев тип.

Operand - a value passed to an operator.

Primitive value - a value that cannot be broken up into smaller representations
				  of data

Literal - a value given exactly as it is meant to be interpreted

Difference between bitwise and logical operator:

A bitwise ("побитов" in Bulgarian) operator compares the values' binary representations.
A logical operator compares the operands boolean representations.

Operator's associativity(operator fixity):
It can be three types - left-to-right, right-to-left or nonassociative.
Operator associativity determines how operators of the same precedence are grouped in the
absence of parentheses.

Short-circuiting - when two values are evaluated with a logical OR operator, the evaluation stops
if the first value is false (also called minimal evaluation and McCarthy Evaluation).

Assignment operator - =, ^=, *=, += etc

OOP Objects interaction:
- Inheritance (Is a)
- Composition (has a)
- Aggregation (has a)
The semantic difference between aggregation and composition is that in aggregation the child can exist independently in the parent.

Generalization is a mechanism for combining similar classes of objects into a single, more general class. Generalization identifies commonalities among a set of entities. 

Specialization is the reverse process of Generalization means creating new sub classes from an existing class.

Lazy evaluation

Във всички прогрмани езици оператора за присвояване връща присвоената стойност.

reference counting
symbol table - a data structure used by programming language interpreters
copy-on-write
copy ellision - C++ compiler optimization
return value optiomization

XOR(^) - eXclusive OR
1 | 0 - returns true
0 | 1 - returns true
0 | 0 - returns false
1 | 1 - returns false

~ - bitwise NOT

This operator makes the operand negative and then substracts one (e.g. if the
operand is 100, -101 will be returned).

It can be used for rounding:

~~12.34 returns 12 in JS

Race condition

Difference between parameter and an argument:
An argument is passed when calling the function.
A parameter is passed when declaring the function.

The variable through which we keep track of a while or for loop is called an index variable.

int functionExample (int param) {
	//some expression here
}

void main() {
	functionExample(argument);
}

Deterministic function -a function that always returns the same output for a particular input

A hashing function is a one-way function. Even a "return 0" statement may be considered a
"hashing function". Information is lost when hashing.

Hash collision - when different objects have the same hash value

GNU style CLI options:
--myoption

XF86 style CLI options:
-myoption

command line options are also known as switches and flags

Keyword and positional arguments:
	In shell scripting and CLI a keyword argument is preceded by an identifier.
E.g.:
	command --name argument
	A positional argument is parsed according to the position on which it is passed to the command

Heap - not to be confused with the tree-like abstract data type. Memory pool from which dynamically
allocated memory is allocated.

map/filter/reduce/all/any - функции, типични за функционалните езици

Event-Worker model
PubSub - publish/subscribe pattern

Explicit
Implicit
http://cboard.cprogramming.com/cplusplus-programming/24371-implicit-explicit.html
(also see page 87 of "Eloquent JavaScript" for abstracton)

Absatraction - abstractions hide implementation details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher
or more abstract layer.

The following are different types of assigning a type to a variable:
Type coersing
Type casting
Type conversion
Type juggling - like in a dynamic language like PHP when we specify implicitly the data type of a variable
e.g.
$int = (int) 1;

index variable - the variable that gets mutated over loop executions and on which the loop execution
				 depends

% - remainder/modulo operator

horizontal scaling

Parity bit (also check bit)
A bit added at the end of binary code that indicates wether the number of bits in the string is odd
or even. It is used in RAID to implement parity. It is a method for error detection.

	mark parity - when parity bit is present and not used and is always 1
	space parity - when parity bit is present and not used and is always 0

Least significant bit (LSB) - the bit position in a binary integer which is determining wether if the
number is odd or even. Usually this is the last bit position.
Most significant bit (MSB) - 1. a bit position in a binary number having the highest value or
2. the sign bit - the first bit which is responsible for determining a signed number's sign

Method signature - the type of arguments, method name and return type of a method

Transfer of control

The code sqrt (a[i]), which is known as a function call on the static method sqrt(),
causes a transfer ofcontrol (to the first line of code in sqrt ()),
each time that it is encountered.
The statements in sqrt() are executed in sequence, as usual, until reaching a return statement,
which transfers control back to the statement in main().

Function call

Functional polymorphism:
Some languages support the declaring of functions with the same name and different number of arguments.
The function being called is designated upon the number of arguments being passed to the instance.

Polymorphic function -a function that treats an argument accordingly to
its type.

Row-and-column maojr order:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order

|| - conjunction operator
&& - disjunction operator

*,[] and & are operators in C/C++.

C structs are allocated on the stack. They don't have OOP behavior, this is just a way to group
variables together. (Sometimes referred as "Plain old data structures").

vectors are the resizable, dynamic high-level arrays in C++.

Abstraction leak - an abstraction leaks when the user is expected to understand the underlying
technology that is being abstracted.

Soft leak - an object is still being referenced from the stack but not used

Higher-order functions:

In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function (also functional, functional form
or functor) is a function that does at least one of the following:

takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e., procedural parameters) or
returns a function as its result.

Permutation - множество от комбинации между няколко стойности

high coupling
high/low cohesion

The Unix Epoch date (January 01 1970) is in the Greewich Mean Time (GMT) time zone.

Big O notation
In computer programming, we use big O notation to talk about the performance of
algorithms. It’s pretty clear that it is better for code to take 1 second than 10 seconds to
do the same thing. This is called an order of magnitude difference.

Optimistic concurrency control (sometimes referred to as optimistic locking) is a
method where instead of locking a piece of data and preventing it from being read or
updated while the lock is in place, the piece of data includes a version number. Every
time the data is updated, the version number increases. When updating the data, the
version number is checked to see if it has increased between the time the client read
the data and the time it submits the update. If this happens, the update is rejected
and the client must re-read the new data and try to update it again.

depth-first search - traverses the structure from the root to an arbitrary leaf and then navigates
back up toward the root, traversing fully down any paths it skipped along the way
breadth-first search - starts at the root and processes all elements of each particular depth
before proceeding to the next level

Object-oriented programming

constructors besides being executed at the initialization of an object, also are actually functions that
return a new object. This is the reason constructors are private in some design patterns
(e.g. singleton).

Mixins - language constructs (most commonly specific types of classes) that provide a way of code
		 reusability without being inherited. (E.g. friend classes in C++, traits in PHP, Modules in
		 Ruby).

SOLID principles
Single responsibility - a class has a single purpose
Open closed - able to extend a classes behavior without modifying it

Data structures

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Stacks%20and%20Queues/Stacks%20and%20Queues.html
http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/43stack/

Node, edge, root, child, children, siblings, parent, ancestor, descendant, predecessor,
successor, internal node, leaf, depth, height, subtree

Access, insert, delete, find, sort - most common operations for data structures

Complexity - what makes a solution better is when it has better complexity
time complexity - how fast an algorithm is - the change in speed in an algorithm with respect
	to the input size
space complexity - how much memory an algorithm uses up
space/time complexity

Asymptomic analysis

The unit we use for time complexity is called an elementary operation. This operation usually
represents an operation to access a single memory slot.

O(1) - as the input increases, the speed of the algorithm doesn't increase
O(N) - linear time complexity - as the size of the input increases, the speed increases linearly
O(N^2) - 

edge - "ребро"
sibling - nodes on the same "level", are on the same distance from the root
ancestor
descendant - all subsequent nodes
predecessor - в контекста на конкретно обхождане това е предхождащия възел
leaf - a node without child nodes
internal node - a node with a child node(opposite of leaf)
depth - "дълбочина" - определена позиция спрямо root-a
height - "височина" - най-далечната позиция спрямо root-a (max depth)
subtree - "поддърво"- и листото може да се счита за поддърво

Types of data structures:
- random access data structures - nodes can be accessed at any time by all means, e.g. arrays in
  higher level programming languages
- sequential access data structure - each element can be accessed only in particular order
	- limited access data structure - subcase of sequential access data structure. Elements
									 can be added and accessed only at a certain point.
- linear structures - lists, stacks, queues

Random access memory is called 'random' behause accessing each place in memory takes
the same time (like an array).

Different types of data structures are more suitable for particular types of operations.

Array

	Rectangular array = two-dimensional array
	Jagged array - array of arrays with varying size

	We can use binary search for optimization if the values are ordered and are all integers.

	NB!!! Binary searches can be performed only in ordered data

List - each element in a list holds a reference to the next element

Stack - "купчина" - push and pop operations off the end of the data structure - LIFO (Last-in, First-out)
	A pop operation should also return the value it removed off the stack.

	Returning to the last pages opened by modern-day web browsers is implemented with a stack structure.
	Another application are "undo" operations in text editors.

Queue - "опашка" - first-in, first-out. The methods for removing elements off a queue are usually named
	enqueue and dequeue. A queue is a linear collection. (Array.prototype.shift and Array.prototype.unshift)

Deck or DEQ(ue)/Double-ended que - FILO structure - the elements can be enqueued and deqeueued in
	both beginning and end.

Ring buffer - FIFO structure with a fixed size.

Set - all values in a set are unique. Similar to sets in math.

Operations with the set abstract data type:
- union - the elements from all the sets with removed duplicates
- intersection - the set of elements the sets have in common
- difference - the elements that are unique when comparing one of the sets against the rest

A heap is a type of tree-like structure where the child nodes' values are ordered depending on their
parents value.

Binary heap - heap structure implemented with a binary tree

	Binary max heap - each child node is smaller or equal to the parent
	Binary min heap - each child node is bigger or equal to the parent

heapq - python heap implementation in the standard library

Linked list

	A linked list is a type of graph
	head - first element
	tail - last element

	operations in doubly linked list:
	- setHead
	- setTail
	- insertBefore
	- insertAfter
	- insertAtPosition
	- removeNodesWithValue
	- remove
	- containsNodeWithValue

Trees

	The root doesn't have child nodes. Each node carries information for their child node.
	Each node in a tree can have exactly one parent node.

	Връзките между node-овете са еднопосочни в дърветата винаги - от parent към child.

	Binary tree - each node cannot have more than two children (left and right).
	Usually the first node (root) of the binary tree starts from the top.
	The children on the left of the root have lower values and those on the right
	side have higher values of the root.

	Unballanced tree - when the levels on both sides of the three are different.

	Traversing binary trees:

	Pre-order: root, left, right
	In-order: left, root, child
	Post-order:left, rigth, child

	Binary search tree - foreach node(x) in the tree:

		- All the elements in the left subtree of x are <=x
		- All the elements in the right subtree of x are >=x

	Binary search trees are balanced

	Red-Black Tree
	AVL Tree
	B-Tree

	Tree Set - type of Red and Black tree

	Rope - type of balanced tree

	Complete binary tree
	full binary tree

	Heap - a type of binary tree in which each level is complete, e.g. each node has 2
	child nodes. The last level may not be complete, but the nodes that have children are
	complete, e.g. have two children. Another property it satisfies is the heap property.
	It determines wether a heap is a min heap or a max heap. In a min heap, the root
	node is the smallest. All child nodes are bigger than their parent. In a max heap,
	it's the reverse.

	Heaps are oftenly represented as integer arrays. This is the formula to retrieve the elements:
	i - node index
	2i + 1 - left node
	2i + 2 - right node
	(i - 1) / 2 - parent node

	The easiest operation for a heap is adding the root node. This is why it's preferred when we
	need to change the root node.

	sift down, sift up, insert, remove, build heap - heap operations

Two algorithms for traversing trees and graphs:
BFS - Breadth-first Search
DFS - Depth-first search

Graphs

	Similar to a tree. The main difference is that nodes may have more than one parent node.
	The root of a graph has the same properties as the root of a tree.

	Връзките в тях могат и да са двупосочни за разлика от тези в дърворидните структури,
	които се обхождат само в една посока.

	Linked lists, trees , heaps - types of graphs, but highly restricted

Hash table

	Each node in a hash table may have more than one value.
	Collision - when two nodes need to enter the same position.
	Collision resolutions - a method to resolve a collision.
	One form of collision resolutions is to from a linked list with the colliding values.

	Searching in a hash table is fast. Other operations may be slow.

Linked lists

	They usually end up with a null valie. Each node in a linked list contains the rest of the
	subsequent nodes.

Images and image processing

Font rasterization is the process of converting text from a vector description.
(as found in scalable fonts such as TrueType fonts) to a raster or bitmap description.

Tweening -
Short for in-betweening, the process of generating intermediate frames between two images to give the
appearance that the first image evolves smoothly into the second image. Tweening is a key process in
all types of animation, including computer animation. Sophisticated animation software enables you
to identify specific objects in an image and define how they should move
and change during the tweening process.
