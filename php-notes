exit - can accept an integer and a string as a parameter.
When we pass an integer to it, this would become the exit status of the PHP process.
If we pass a string, it will be printed upon exiting the PHP script. The die() keyword
behaves in the second way.

require_once and include_once will ignore any further attemts to include a file
which is already included.


Directives that can be set with the declare keyword:
encoding and tick functions.

A tick function can be triggered in a block of code passed to declare
after a number of executions:

declare(ticks = 3) {
	for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
		//do something
	}
}

A tick function is registered with register_tick_function().

declare(encoding = "UTF-8"); - it can be used only if you
compile PHP with the --enable-zend-multibyte.

Functions are compiled only once when a script is initialized

page 64 - we can include HTML code in function declarations, similarly to
using shorthand PHP tags in templates.

page 70 - we cannot pass a complex expression as a default value of a
function, only a scalar expression.

page 70 contains a typo - count_list().
page 71 - type hinting of function declaration.

The range of the integer type in PHP depends on the range of the long data type of the C compiler
with whom the PHP execuitalbe was built. Most commonly it is in the following range:
âˆ’2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647

Classes cannot be redeclared in PHP or "reopened" as in Ruby. A fatal error will be thrown after
attempting to do so.

NB!!!
In PHP only functions are scope gates. Loops aren't. Index variables remain in the local
scope after loop execution.

"binary safe" - in the context of PHP this means that strings can't contain null bytes.

Compile time options

--enable-short-tags - disabled by default
--enable-asp-tags - disabled by default
--enable-trans-id - add the PHP session id to each HTML file
--with-xmlrpc - add support for XML-RPC extensions

PHP INI

allow_url_include - allows the inclusion of PHP files over HTTP (bad security practise)
allow_url_fopen - allows  the opening of files with fopen over HTTP or FTP
ini_set('html_errors', false); - make HTML PHP errors to be displayed into plain text
session.save_path - each PHP session is saved in a file. We can specify it with this directive.
disable_functions - disable builtin PHP functions

PHP programming (O'Reilly) page 351 - error reporting directives

variables_order - the order in which the superglobal arrays are preloaded with information.
The default order is EGPCS($_ENV, $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE and $_SERVER).

request_order - describes the way PHP registers POST, GET and Cookie variables into the $_REQUEST
array.

ignore_repeated_errors - supresses repeating errors being logged, but only from the same line on the
same PHP script

PHP Pitfals

$asd = false;

if (isset($asd)) {
    echo 'ok';
}

// This will output 'ok'!

$asd = null;

if (isset($asd)) {
	echo 'ok';
}

// This will not output the string

PHP OOP

We can use the following sintax to call a parent's constructor:

class Grandpa
{
    public function __construct()
    {

    }

}

class Papa extends Grandpa
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        // call Grandpa's constructor
        Grandpa::__construct(); #this is the same as parent::__construct();
    }
}

PHP doesn't call the parent class'es construct except when stated explicitly.

get_included_files() - returns an array with the included files (files with
Parse error are excluded).
