Indexers - they process incoming machine data storing it in indexes as events. As the indexer indexes data it creates a number of files organized in sets of directories by age.
Search Heads - allows users to search the Splunk language to search the directories with indexed data. They handle search requests from users and distribute the requests to the indexers, which perform the actual search. After that search heads then consolidate and return the result. 
Forwarders - Splunk Enterprise instances. They are installed on remote machines. They collect data and send it to the indexes.

Those three aren't all the components of splunk.
