AWS Budgets lets customers set custom budgets and receive alerts if their costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) their budgeted amount.

AWS requires approximately 5 weeks of usage data to generate budget forecasts - AWS requires approximately 5 weeks of usage data to generate budget forecasts. If you set a budget to alert based on a forecasted amount, this budget alert isn't triggered until you have enough historical usage information.
 If the user account does not have enough privileges, the user will not be able to create the budget at all.
 Stand-alone accounts too can create budgets and being part of an Organization is not mandatory to use AWS Budgets.

-- IAM and access control

The following policy types only limit permissions but cannot grant permissions:
AWS Organizations Service Control Policy (SCP) – Use an AWS Organizations Service Control Policy (SCP) to define the maximum permissions for account members of an organization or organizational unit (OU). SCPs limit permissions that identity-based policies or resource-based policies grant to entities (users or roles) within the account, but do not grant permissions.

Permissions boundary - Permissions boundary is a managed policy that is used for an IAM entity (user or role). The policy defines the maximum permissions that the identity-based policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant permissions.

Overview of Policy Types:  
https://media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q59-i1.jpg
via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html

IAM policy principal - You can use the Principal element in a policy to specify the principal that is allowed or denied access to a resource (In IAM, a principal is a person or application that can make a request for an action or operation on an AWS resource. The principal is authenticated as the AWS account root user or an IAM entity to make requests to AWS). You cannot use the Principal element in an IAM identity-based policy. You can use it in the trust policies for IAM roles and in resource-based policies.

IAM policy condition - The Condition element (or Condition block) lets you specify conditions for when a policy is in effect, like so - "Condition" : { "StringEquals" : { "aws:username" : "johndoe" }}.

IAM policy resource - The Resource element specifies the object or objects that the statement covers. You specify a resource using an ARN.

IAM policy variables

Instead of creating individual policies for each user, you can use policy variables and create a single policy that applies to multiple users (a group policy). Policy variables act as placeholders. When you make a request to AWS, the placeholder is replaced by a value from the request when the policy is evaluated.

As an example, the following policy gives each of the users in the group full programmatic access to a user-specific object (their own "home directory") in Amazon S3.

via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html

Access Advisor feature on IAM console - To help identify the unused roles, IAM reports the last-used timestamp that represents when a role was last used to make an AWS request. Your security team can use this information to identify, analyze, and then confidently remove unused roles. This helps improve the security posture of your AWS environments

In case you want to give permissions for a resource in one account to a resource in another
(the example is with a DynamoDB table and AWS Lambda function in another account)

You can give a Lambda function created in one account ("account A") permissions to assume a role from another account ("account B") to access resources such as DynamoDB or S3 bucket. You need to create an execution role in Account A that gives the Lambda function permission to do its work. Then you need to create a role in account B that the Lambda function in account A assumes to gain access to the cross-account DynamoDB table. Make sure that you modify the trust policy of the role in Account B to allow the execution role of Lambda to assume this role. Finally, update the Lambda function code to add the AssumeRole API call.

Sample use-case to configure a Lambda function to assume a role from another AWS account:
https://media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q1-i1.jpg
via - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-function-assume-iam-role/

You cannot attach a resource policy to a DynamoDB

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html

The development team has just configured and attached the IAM policy needed to access AWS Billing and Cost Management for all users under the Finance department. But, the users are unable to see AWS Billing and Cost Management service in the AWS console. What could be the reason for this issue?

You need to activate IAM user access to the Billing and Cost Management console for all the users who need access - By default, IAM users do not have access to the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. You or your account administrator must grant users access. You can do this by activating IAM user access to the Billing and Cost Management console and attaching an IAM policy to your users. Then, you need to activate IAM user access for IAM policies to take effect. You only need to activate IAM user access once.

You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource such as an Amazon S3 bucket. These policies grant the specified principal permission to perform specific actions on that resource and define under what conditions this applies.

Trust policy - Trust policies define which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated users) can assume the role. An IAM role is both an identity and a resource that supports resource-based policies. For this reason, you must attach both a trust policy and an identity-based policy to an IAM role. The IAM service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role trust policy, which is attached to an IAM role.

AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCP) - If you enable all features of AWS organization, then you can apply service control policies (SCPs) to any or all of your accounts. SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit (OU). The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow.


Access control list (ACL) - Access control lists (ACLs) are service policies that allow you to control which principals in another account can access a resource. ACLs cannot be used to control access for a principal within the same account. Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC are examples of services that support ACLs.

Permissions boundary - AWS supports permissions boundaries for IAM entities (users or roles). A permissions boundary is an advanced feature for using a managed policy to set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. An entity's permissions boundary allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.

Access Advisor feature on IAM console- To help identify the unused roles, IAM reports the last-used timestamp that represents when a role was last used to make an AWS request. Your security team can use this information to identify, analyze, and then confidently remove unused roles. This helps improve the security posture of your AWS environments. Additionally, by removing unused roles, you can simplify your monitoring and auditing efforts by focusing only on roles that are in use. This feature can help us identify unused IAM roles and remove them without disrupting any service.

Compute and Networking

-- EC2

Burstable performance instances, which are T3, T3a, and T2 instances, are designed to provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst to a higher level when required by your workload. Burstable performance instances are the only instance types that use credits for CPU usage.

0 seconds - AWS states that, if your AWS account is less than 12 months old, you can use a t2.micro instance for free within certain usage limits.
Reference:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html

Dedicated Instances - Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer. Dedicated Instances that belong to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at a hardware level, even if those accounts are linked to a single-payer account. However, Dedicated Instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not Dedicated Instances.

A Dedicated Host is also a physical server that's dedicated for your use. With a Dedicated Host, you have visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server.

Differences between Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Instances:

Spot Instances - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Your Spot Instance runs whenever capacity is available and the maximum price per hour for your request exceeds the Spot price. Any instance present with unused capacity will be allocated. Even though this is cost-effective, it does not fulfill the single-tenant hardware requirement of the client and hence is not the correct option.

Dedicated Hosts - An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your existing software licenses on EC2 instances. With a Dedicated Host, you have visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server. This option is costlier than the Dedicated Instance and hence is not the right choice for the current requirement.

On-Demand Instances - With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. You have full control over its lifecycle—you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. Hardware isolation is not possible and on-demand has one of the costliest instance charges and hence is not the correct answer for current requirements.

We can decrease EC2 instance load in case of secure traffic via HTTPS in the following way:
"Configure an SSL/TLS certificate on an Application Load Balancer via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)"

"Create an HTTPS listener on the Application Load Balancer with SSL termination"

An Application load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure. The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/images/component_architecture.png
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html

To use an HTTPS listener, you must deploy at least one SSL/TLS server certificate on your load balancer. You can create an HTTPS listener, which uses encrypted connections (also known as SSL offload). This feature enables traffic encryption between your load balancer and the clients that initiate SSL or TLS sessions. As the EC2 instances are under heavy CPU load, the load balancer will use the server certificate to terminate the front-end connection and then decrypt requests from clients before sending them to the EC2 instances.

Elastic Reserved instances - This option has been added as a distractor. There are no Elastic Reserved Instance types.

Reserved Instances offer significant savings on Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. A Reserved Instance can be purchased for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances come with two offering classes - Standard or Convertible.

Standard Reserved instances - With Standard Reserved Instances, some attributes, such as instance size, can be modified during the term; however, the instance family cannot be modified. You cannot exchange a Standard Reserved Instance, only modify it

Scheduled Reserved instances - Scheduled Reserved Instances (Scheduled Instances) enable you to purchase capacity reservations that recur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, with a specified start time and duration, for a one-year term. You reserve the capacity in advance so that you know it is available when you need it.

Convertible Reserved instances - A Convertible Reserved Instance can be exchanged during the term for another Convertible Reserved Instance with new attributes including instance family, instance type, platform, scope, or tenancy. This is the best fit for the current requirement.

Auto Scaling groups cannot span across multiple Regions.
Auto Scaling groups can span across the availability Zones of a Region.
When one Availability Zone becomes unhealthy or unavailable, Auto Scaling launches new instances in an unaffected Availability Zone. When the unhealthy Availability Zone returns to a healthy state, Auto Scaling automatically redistributes the application instances evenly across all of the designated Availability Zones.
An Auto Scaling group can contain EC2 instances in one or more Availability Zones within the same Region.
For Auto Scaling groups in a VPC, the EC2 instances are launched in subnets. Customers can select the subnets for your EC2 instances when you create or update the Auto Scaling group.

By default, scripts entered as user data are executed with root user privileges - Scripts entered as user data are executed as the root user, hence do not need the sudo command in the script. Any files you create will be owned by root; if you need non-root users to have file access, you should modify the permissions accordingly in the script.

By default, user data runs only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance - By default, user data scripts and cloud-init directives run only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance. You can update your configuration to ensure that your user data scripts and cloud-init directives run every time you restart your instance.

-- ELB - Elastic Load balancer

ALB access logs - Elastic Load Balancing provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer. Each log contains information such as the time the request was received, the client's IP address, latencies, request paths, and server responses. You can use these access logs to analyze traffic patterns and troubleshoot issues. Access logging is an optional feature of Elastic Load Balancing that is disabled by default.
https://media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q29-i1.jpg
via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html

Elastic Load Balancers can connect with Auto Scale groups to provide horizontal scaling.
A Load Balancer can target EC2 instances only within an AWS Region.

https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html

ALB request tracing - You can use request tracing to track HTTP requests. The load balancer adds a header with a trace identifier to each request it receives. Request tracing will not help you to analyze latency specific data.

ALB HTTP status response options:
HTTP 503 - HTTP 503 indicates 'Service unavailable' error. This error in ALB is an indicator of the target groups for the load balancer having no registered targets.

HTTP 500 - HTTP 500 indicates 'Internal server' error. There are several reasons for their error: A client submitted a request without an HTTP protocol, and the load balancer was unable to generate a redirect URL, there was an error executing the web ACL rules.

HTTP 504 - HTTP 504 is 'Gateway timeout' error. Several reasons for this error, to quote a few: The load balancer failed to establish a connection to the target before the connection timeout expired, The load balancer established a connection to the target but the target did not respond before the idle timeout period elapsed.

HTTP 403 - HTTP 403 is 'Forbidden' error. You configured an AWS WAF web access control list (web ACL) to monitor requests to your Application Load Balancer and it blocked a request.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-troubleshooting.html

You must ensure that your load balancer can communicate with registered targets on both the listener port and the health check port. Whenever you add a listener to your load balancer or update the health check port for a target group used by the load balancer to route requests, you must verify that the security groups associated with the load balancer allow traffic on the new port in both directions.

IAM Access Analyzer - AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps you identify the resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM roles, that are shared with an external entity. This lets you identify unintended access to your resources and data, which is a security risk.

You can set the scope for the analyzer to an organization or an AWS account. This is your zone of trust. The analyzer scans all of the supported resources within your zone of trust. When Access Analyzer finds a policy that allows access to a resource from outside of your zone of trust, it generates an active finding.

S3 Analytics - By using Amazon S3 analytics Storage Class Analysis you can analyze storage access patterns to help you decide when to transition the right data to the right storage class.

-- Encryption / -- AWS KMS / -- KMS / -- CloudHSM / -- AWS CloudHSM

KMS stores the CMK, and receives data from the clients, which it encrypts and sends back. This is how
KMS encryption works.

A customer master key (CMK) is a logical representation of a master key. The CMK includes metadata, such as the key ID, creation date, description, and key state. The CMK also contains the key material used to encrypt and decrypt data. You can generate CMKs in KMS, in an AWS CloudHSM cluster, or import them from your key management infrastructure.

AWS KMS supports symmetric and asymmetric CMKs. A symmetric CMK represents a 256-bit key that is used for encryption and decryption. An asymmetric CMK represents an RSA key pair that is used for encryption and decryption or signing and verification (but not both), or an elliptic curve (ECC) key pair that is used for signing and verification.

AWS KMS supports three types of CMKs: customer-managed CMKs, AWS managed CMKs, and AWS owned CMKs.

Overview of Customer master keys (CMKs):

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html

The following two services can be used to deploy TLS/SSL certificates in AWS:
- IAM -  IAM is used as a certificate manager only when you must support HTTPS connections in a Region that is not supported by ACM. IAM securely encrypts your private keys and stores the encrypted version in IAM SSL certificate storage. IAM supports deploying server certificates in all Regions, but you must obtain your certificate from an external provider for use with AWS. You cannot upload an ACM certificate to IAM. Additionally, you cannot manage your certificates from the IAM Console.
- AWS Certificate manager - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is the preferred tool to provision, manage, and deploy server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate or deploy an existing ACM or external certificate to AWS resources. Certificates provided by ACM are free and automatically renew. In a supported Region, you can use ACM to manage server certificates from the console or programmatically.

CloudFront Key pairs can only be created by the root user.
For Amazon CloudFront, you use key pairs to create signed URLs for private content, such as when you want to distribute restricted content that someone paid for.

.ebextensions/<mysettings>.config : You can add AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration files (.ebextensions) to your web application's source code to configure your environment and customize the AWS resources that it contains. Configuration files are YAML or JSON formatted documents with a .config file extension that you place in a folder named .ebextensions and deploy in your application source bundle.

With deployment policies such as 'All at once', AWS Elastic Beanstalk performs an in-place update when you update your application versions and your application can become unavailable to users for a short period of time. You can avoid this downtime by performing a blue/green deployment, where you deploy the new version to a separate environment, and then swap CNAMEs (via Route 53) of the two environments to redirect traffic to the new version instantly. In case of any deployment issues, the rollback process is very quick via swapping the URLs for the two environments.

Overview of Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Policies:
https://media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q10-i1.jpg
via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.deploy-existing-version.html

'All at once' deployment policy - Although 'All at once' is the quickest deployment method, but the application may become unavailable to users (or have low availability) for a short time. 

'Rolling' deployment policy - This policy avoids downtime and minimizes reduced availability, at a cost of a longer deployment time. 

Deploy the new application version using 'Rolling with additional batch' deployment policy - This policy avoids any reduced availability, at a cost of an even longer deployment time compared to the Rolling method. Suitable if you must maintain the same bandwidth throughout the deployment.

Any resources created as part of your .ebextensions is part of your Elastic Beanstalk template and will get deleted if the environment is terminated.

https://media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q23-i1.jpg
 via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/ebextensions.html

  To decouple your database instance from your environment, you can run a database instance in Amazon RDS and configure your application to connect to it on launch. This enables you to connect multiple environments to a database, terminate an environment without affecting the database, and perform seamless updates with blue-green deployments. To allow the Amazon EC2 instances in your environment to connect to an outside database, you can configure the environment's Auto Scaling group with an additional security group.


Using Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon RDS:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-environment-resources-elasticache.html

The rolling deployment policy deploys the new version in batches. Each batch is taken out of service during the deployment phase, reducing your environment's capacity by the number of instances in a batch. The cost remains the same as the number of EC2 instances does not increase. This policy avoids downtime and minimizes reduced availability, at a cost of a longer deployment time.

Overview of Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Policies:

https://media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q22-i1.jpg

Deploy using 'Rolling with additional batch' deployment policy - With this method, Elastic Beanstalk launches an extra batch of instances, then performs a rolling deployment. Launching the extra batch takes time, and ensures that the same bandwidth is retained throughout the deployment. This policy also avoids any reduced availability, although at a cost of an even longer deployment time compared to the Rolling method. Finally, this option is suitable if you must maintain the same bandwidth throughout the deployment.

Deploy using 'Immutable' deployment policy - A slower deployment method, that ensures your new application version is always deployed to new instances, instead of updating existing instances. It also has the additional advantage of a quick and safe rollback in case the deployment fails. With this method, Elastic Beanstalk performs an immutable update to deploy your application. In an immutable update, a second Auto Scaling group is launched in your environment and the new version serves traffic alongside the old version until the new instances pass health checks.

Deploy using 'All at once' deployment policy - This is the quickest deployment method. Suitable if you can accept a short loss of service, and if quick deployments are important to you. With this method, Elastic Beanstalk deploys the new application version to each instance. Then, the web proxy or application server might need to restart. As a result, your application might be unavailable to users (or have low availability) for a short time.

Deploy using 'Rolling' deployment policy - With this method, your application is deployed to your environment one batch of instances at a time. Most bandwidth is retained throughout the deployment. Avoids downtime and minimizes reduced availability, at a cost of a longer deployment time. Suitable if you can't accept any period of completely lost service.

-- AWS CodePipeline / -- Amazon CodePipeline / -- CodePipeline
-- AWS CodeBuild / -- CodeBuild

To prevent a build running for too long, we need to enable CodeBuild timeouts.

A build represents a set of actions performed by AWS CodeBuild to create output artifacts (for example, a JAR file) based on a set of input artifacts (for example, a collection of Java class files).
The following rules apply when you run multiple builds:
When possible, builds run concurrently. The maximum number of concurrently running builds can vary.
Builds are queued if the number of concurrently running builds reaches its limit. The maximum number of builds in a queue is five times the concurrent build limit.
A build in a queue that does not start after the number of minutes specified in its time out value is removed from the queue. The default timeout value is eight hours. You can override the build queue timeout with a value between five minutes and eight hours when you run your build.
By setting the timeout configuration, the build process will automatically terminate post the expiry of the configured timeout.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/builds-working.html

With the Local Build support for AWS CodeBuild, you just specify the location of your source code, choose your build settings, and CodeBuild runs build scripts for compiling, testing, and packaging your code. You can use the AWS CodeBuild agent to test and debug builds on a local machine.

By building an application on a local machine you can:
Test the integrity and contents of a buildspec file locally.
Test and build an application locally before committing.
Identify and fix errors quickly from your local development environment.

AWS CodeBuild is integrated with AWS CloudTrail.
CloudTrail captures all API calls for CodeBuild as events, including calls from the CodeBuild console and from code calls to the CodeBuild APIs.

The following can be used for authentication against CodeCommit:
Git credentials - These are IAM -generated user name and password pair you can use to communicate with CodeCommit repositories over HTTPS.
SSH Keys - Are locally generated public-private key pair that you can associate with your IAM user to communicate with CodeCommit repositories over SSH.
AWS access keys - You can use these keys with the credential helper included with the AWS CLI to communicate with CodeCommit repositories over HTTPS.

Infrastructure as Code

-- AWS CloudFormation / -- CloudFormation

https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/

Sample CloudFormation YAML template (print the image when printing):
https://media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q60-i1.jpg
via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html

'Conditions' section of the template - This optional section includes conditions that control whether certain resources are created or whether certain resource properties are assigned a value during stack creation or update. For example, you could conditionally create a resource that depends on whether the stack is for a production or test environment.
The optional Conditions section contains statements that define the circumstances under which entities are created or configured. For example, you can create a condition and then associate it with a resource or output so that AWS CloudFormation only creates the resource or output if the condition is true.
You might use conditions when you want to reuse a template that can create resources in different contexts, such as a test environment versus a production environment. In your template, you can add an EnvironmentType input parameter, which accepts either prod or test as inputs. For the production environment, you might include Amazon EC2 instances with certain capabilities; however, for the test environment, you want to use reduced capabilities to save money.
Conditions cannot be used within the Parameters section. After you define all your conditions, you can associate them with resources and resource properties only in the Resources and Outputs sections of a template.


'Resources' section of the template - This is the only required section and specifies the stack resources and their properties, such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance or an Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket. You can refer to resources in the Resources and Outputs sections of the template.

'Parameters' section of the template - This optional section is helpful in passing Values to your template at runtime (when you create or update a stack). You can refer to parameters from the Resources and Outputs sections of the template.
Parameters enable you to input custom values to your CloudFormation template each time you create or update a stack.
This is how we can define a parameter in a template:

via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/conditions-section-structure.html

Outputs - The optional Outputs section declares output values that you can import into other stacks (to create cross-stack references), return in response (to describe stack calls), or view on the AWS CloudFormation console. For example, you can output the S3 bucket name for a stack to make the bucket easier to find. You can associate conditions with the outputs that you want to conditionally create.


You can create a cross-stack reference to export resources from one AWS CloudFormation stack to another. For example, you might have a network stack with a VPC and subnets and a separate public web application stack. To use the security group and subnet from the network stack, you can create a cross-stack reference that allows the web application stack to reference resource outputs from the network stack. With a cross-stack reference, owners of the web application stacks don't need to create or maintain networking rules or assets.

To create a cross-stack reference, use the Export output field to flag the value of a resource output for export. Then, use the Fn::ImportValue intrinsic function to import the value.

You cannot use the Ref intrinsic function to import the value.

via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/walkthrough-crossstackref.html

Pseudo parameters are parameters that are predefined by AWS CloudFormation. You do not declare them in your template. Use them the same way as you would a parameter, as the argument for the Ref function.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/pseudo-parameter-reference.html

Pseudo parameters:
AWS::Partition
Returns the partition that the resource is in. For standard AWS Regions, the partition is aws. For resources in other partitions, the partition is aws-partitionname. For example, the partition for resources in the China (Beijing and Ningxia) Region is aws-cn and the partition for resources in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) region is aws-us-gov.

AWS::Region
Returns a string representing the Region in which the encompassing resource is being created, such as us-west-2.

AWS::StackId
Returns the ID of the stack as specified with the aws cloudformation create-stack command, such as arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/teststack/51af3dc0-da77-11e4-872e-1234567db123.

AWS::StackName
Returns the name of the stack as specified with the aws cloudformation create-stack command, such as teststack.

AWS::URLSuffix
Returns the suffix for a domain. The suffix is typically amazonaws.com, but might differ by Region. For example, the suffix for the China (Beijing) Region is amazonaws.com.cn.

https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/walkthrough-crossstackref.html

Using CloudFormation, you can create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.

A CloudFormation template has an optional Outputs section which declares output values that you can import into other stacks (to create cross-stack references), return in response (to describe stack calls), or view on the AWS CloudFormation console. For example, you can output the S3 bucket name for a stack to make the bucket easier to find.

You can use the Export Output Values to export the name of the resource output for a cross-stack reference. For each AWS account, export names must be unique within a region. In this case, we would have a conflict within us-east-2.

!FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ] - The intrinsic function Fn::FindInMap returns the value corresponding to keys in a two-level map that is declared in the Mappings section. YAML Syntax for the full function name: Fn::FindInMap: [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ]

Short form of the above syntax is : !FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ]

Where,

MapName - Is the logical name of a mapping declared in the Mappings section that contains the keys and values. TopLevelKey - The top-level key name. Its value is a list of key-value pairs. SecondLevelKey - The second-level key name, which is set to one of the keys from the list assigned to TopLevelKey.

Consider the following YAML template:

Mappings:
  RegionMap:
    us-east-1:
      HVM64: "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867"
      HVMG2: "ami-0a584ac55a7631c0c"
    us-west-1:
      HVM64: "ami-0bdb828fd58c52235"
      HVMG2: "ami-066ee5fd4a9ef77f1"
    eu-west-1:
      HVM64: "ami-047bb4163c506cd98"
      HVMG2: "ami-31c2f645"
    ap-southeast-1:
      HVM64: "ami-08569b978cc4dfa10"
      HVMG2: "ami-0be9df32ae9f92309"
    ap-northeast-1:
      HVM64: "ami-06cd52961ce9f0d85"
      HVMG2: "ami-053cdd503598e4a9d"
Resources:
  myEC2Instance:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Properties:
      ImageId: !FindInMap
        - RegionMap
        - !Ref 'AWS::Region'
        - HVM64
      InstanceType: m1.small
The example template contains an AWS::EC2::Instance resource whose ImageId property is set by the FindInMap function.

MapName is set to the map of interest, "RegionMap" in this example. TopLevelKey is set to the region where the stack is created, which is determined by using the "AWS::Region" pseudo parameter. SecondLevelKey is set to the desired architecture, "HVM64" for this example.

FindInMap returns the AMI assigned to FindInMap. For a HVM64 instance in us-east-1, FindInMap would return "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867".

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-findinmap.html

The AWS::Serverless transform, which is a macro hosted by AWS CloudFormation, takes an entire template written in the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) syntax and transforms and expands it into a compliant AWS CloudFormation template.

SMS-based MFA is available only for IAM users, you cannot use this type of MFA with the AWS account root user.
Hardware MFA device - This hardware device generates a six-digit numeric code. The user must type this code from the device on a second webpage during sign-in. Each MFA device assigned to a user must be unique. A user cannot type a code from another user's device to be authenticated. Can be used for root user authentication.

U2F security key - A device that you plug into a USB port on your computer. U2F is an open authentication standard hosted by the FIDO Alliance. When you enable a U2F security key, you sign in by entering your credentials and then tapping the device instead of manually entering a code.

Virtual MFA devices - A software app that runs on a phone or other device and emulates a physical device. The device generates a six-digit numeric code. The user must type a valid code from the device on a second webpage during sign-in. Each virtual MFA device assigned to a user must be unique. A user cannot type a code from another user's virtual MFA device to authenticate.

-- Amazon STS / -- AWS STS / -- STS
-- Cognito

After successful authentication, Amazon Cognito returns user pool tokens to your app. You can use the tokens to grant your users access to your own server-side resources, or to the Amazon API Gateway.

Amazon Cognito user pools implement ID, access, and refresh tokens as defined by the OpenID Connect (OIDC) open standard.

The ID token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains claims about the identity of the authenticated user such as name, email, and phone_number. You can use this identity information inside your application. The ID token can also be used to authenticate users against your resource servers or server applications.

"Cognito Identity Pools" - You can use Identity pools to grant your users access to other AWS services. With an identity pool, your users can obtain temporary AWS credentials to access AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and DynamoDB. Identity pools support anonymous guest users, as well as the specific identity providers that you can use to authenticate users for identity pools.

"Cognito Sync" - Amazon Cognito Sync is an AWS service and client library that enables cross-device syncing of application-related user data. You can use it to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and the web without requiring your own backend.

We can use Cognito Authentication via Cognito User Pools with Application Load Balancer

Application Load Balancer can be used to securely authenticate users for accessing your applications. This enables you to offload the work of authenticating users to your load balancer so that your applications can focus on their business logic. You can use Cognito User Pools to authenticate users through well-known social IdPs, such as Amazon, Facebook, or Google, through the user pools supported by Amazon Cognito or through corporate identities, using SAML, LDAP, or Microsoft AD, through the user pools supported by Amazon Cognito. You configure user authentication by creating an authenticate action for one or more listener rules. The authenticate-cognito and authenticate-oidc action types are supported only with HTTPS listeners.

 via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html

For example, you have a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call ChangeMessageVisibility with a timeout of 10 minutes. You can continue to call ChangeMessageVisibility to extend the visibility timeout to the maximum allowed time. If you try to extend the visibility timeout beyond the maximum, your request is rejected. So, for the given use-case, the application can set the initial visibility timeout to 1 minute and then continue to update the ChangeMessageVisibility value if required.

AWS Kinesis Data Streams

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events. The data collected is available in milliseconds to enable real-time analytics use cases such as real-time dashboards, real-time anomaly detection, dynamic pricing, and more.

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams enables real-time processing of streaming big data. It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple Amazon Kinesis Applications. The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) delivers all records for a given partition key to the same record processor, making it easier to build multiple applications reading from the same Amazon Kinesis data stream (for example, to perform counting, aggregation, and filtering). Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is recommended when you need the ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently. For example, you have one application that updates a real-time dashboard and another application that archives data to Amazon Redshift. You want both applications to consume data from the same stream concurrently and independently.

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is useful for rapidly moving data off data producers and then continuously processing the data, be it to transform the data before emitting to a data store, run real-time metrics and analytics, or derive more complex data streams for further processing. Kinesis data streams can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events.

AWS Kinesis Data Firehose - Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you’re already using today. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security. As Kinesis Data Firehose is used to load streaming data into data stores, therefore this option is incorrect.

AWS Kinesis Data Analytics - Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is the easiest way to analyze streaming data in real-time. You can quickly build SQL queries and sophisticated Java applications using built-in templates and operators for common processing functions to organize, transform, aggregate, and analyze data at any scale. Kinesis Data Analytics enables you to easily and quickly build queries and sophisticated streaming applications in three simple steps: setup your streaming data sources, write your queries or streaming applications and set up your destination for processed data. As Kinesis Data Analytics is used to build SQL queries and sophisticated Java applications, therefore this option is incorrect.

Amazon SQS - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent. For SQS, you cannot have the same message being consumed by multiple consumers at the same time, therefore this option is incorrect.

Exam alert:

Please remember that Kinesis Data Firehose is used to load streaming data into data stores (Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk) whereas Kinesis Data Streams provides support for real-time processing of streaming data. It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple downstream Amazon Kinesis Applications.

Serverless Compute

-- AWS Lambda / -- Lambda / -- Amazon Lambda

When a Lambda function is exceeding its concurrency limit we need to set up reserved concurrency limit
so that it throttles if it goes above a certain concurrency limit.
Concurrency is the number of requests that a Lambda function is serving at any given time. If a Lambda function is invoked again while a request is still being processed, another instance is allocated, which increases the function's concurrency.

To ensure that a function can always reach a certain level of concurrency, you can configure the function with reserved concurrency. When a function has reserved concurrency, no other function can use that concurrency. More importantly, reserved concurrency also limits the maximum concurrency for the function, and applies to the function as a whole, including versions and aliases.

How lambda concurrency works:
https://media.datacumulus.com/aws-dva-pt/assets/pt1-q6-i1.jpg
via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html#configuration-concurrency-reserved

You should use provisioned concurrency to enable your function to scale without fluctuations in latency. By allocating provisioned concurrency before an increase in invocations, you can ensure that all requests are served by initialized instances with very low latency. Provisioned concurrency is not used to limit the maximum concurrency for a given Lambda function

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html#configuration-concurrency-reserved
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/lambda-functions-as-targets-for-application-load-balancers/

You can use versions to manage the deployment of your AWS Lambda functions. For example, you can publish a new version of a function for beta testing without affecting users of the stable production version. You can change the function code and settings only on the unpublished version of a function. When you publish a version, the code and most of the settings are locked to ensure a consistent experience for users of that version.

You can create one or more aliases for your AWS Lambda function. A Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. You can use routing configuration on an alias to send a portion of traffic to a Lambda function version. For example, you can reduce the risk of deploying a new version by configuring the alias to send most of the traffic to the existing version, and only a small percentage of traffic to the new version.

EC2 X-Ray Daemon - The AWS X-Ray daemon is a software application that listens for traffic on UDP port 2000, gathers raw segment data, and relays it to the AWS X-Ray API. The daemon logs could help with figuring out the problem.
The X-Ray daemon uses the AWS SDK to upload trace data to X-Ray, and it needs AWS credentials with permission to do that. On Amazon EC2, the daemon uses the instance's instance profile role automatically. Eliminates API permission issues (in case the role doesn't have IAM permissions to write data to the X-Ray service)

You can use X-Ray to collect data across AWS Accounts. The X-Ray agent can assume a role to publish data into an account different from the one in which it is running. This enables you to publish data from various components of your application into a central account.
