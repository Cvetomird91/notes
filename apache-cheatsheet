Apache Web Server

MPM - Multi-processing Module - defines how the server handles requests by setting the relationship
between child processes, threads and users running them

Apache on different OSs - http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/DistrosDefaultLayout It includes different
directories and configuration files locations

Apache 2.0 directories - bin, build, cgi-bin, conf, error, htdocs, icons, include, lib, logs, man
manual, modules

htdigest - manage user files for digest authentication

htcacheclean - a "front-end" for mod_cache_disk which can be used to review cached content,
			   clear cached content or to set limits for disk caching of HTTP responses.

htpasswd - generate password hash for digest autenthication

	htpasswd -c .htpasswd_dev username

LogFormat

Any file that has the handler cgi-script will be treated as a CGI script, and run by the server,
 with its output being returned
to the client. Files acquire this handler either by having a name containing an extension
defined by the AddHandler directive, or by being in a ScriptAlias directory.


ErrorLog - when assigned to a VirtualHost, the errors returned from it will be stored in a separate
	   text file, rather than the default global error log.

Notable Apache modules:

*mod_security
	-Apache auditing tool. Web Application Firewal.
	 Works on a per request basis. Has no way to compare one request to another
	to build a multiple request profile.
	https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual#ModSecurityreg_Reference_Manual

*mod_dumpio
	- allows the complete input and output of each HTTP transaction to be logged

*mod_rewrite

	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/misc/rewriteguide.html
	http://www.branded3.com/blogs/htaccess-mod_rewrite-ultimate-guide/

*mod_log_config
	- Apache Web servers standart activity logging module. Allows the admin to create his
	own formats for structuring the logs.

	LogLevel directive - the default LogLevel is warn

	CustomLog - we can use this directive to assign the format of the logged request. We can
	assign the usage of the rotatelogs program which rotates the logs at a particular time
	automatically.

*mod_logio - enhances mod_log_config. Allows to log the number of bytes transferred over the web

*mod_log_mysql - allows  logging to be done into a MySQL database

*mod_vhost_alias - allows mass virtual hosting - configuring multiple virtual hosts with similar
	settings

*mod_spelling - regulates URL case sensitivity and can give access to a document if a misspelling occurs

*mod_ssl - enable SSL encryption for HTTPS access on a host

*mod_userdir - allows user-specific directories to be accessed using the following URL syntax:
http://example.com/~username/ syntax

*mod_cache

*mod_cache_disk - mod_cache must be loaded first to use this module. Enables the storing of headers
				  and bodies are stored separately on disk.

Directory for the cache on a Debian-based system:
/var/cache/apache2/mod_cache_disk/

Enable mod_userdir for only a few users:
UserDir disabled
UserDir enabled user1 user2 user3

disable only for specific users:
UserDir disabled user4 user5 user6

Set a specific directory name as document root in a user's directory:

UserDir public_html - this will set /home/*/public_html/ to be the document
		root for http://example.com/~username/

UserDir /var/html/ - this will set the document root for http://example.com/~username/ to be /var/html/username/

*mod_proxy

Apache::BruteWatch - watches the logfile and sends a notification when an account is being
	targetet for a brute force attack. It requires mod_perl to work.

SetEnvIfNoCase - we can use this directive to turn off logging of requests. For example to prevent
		logging of those requests from our own pages. This is useful for keeping logfile
		size for example. Same as SetEnvIf, but Case insensitive
