	After Windows Server 2012 RT installation:
	Unmount ISO

	Enable RDP and other services:
	Server Manager -> Dashboard -> Server Roles -> add services

	To install IIS:
	We need to install also .NET 3.5 along with .NET 4.5

	when installing SQL server -> Use stand alone when installing a server for web,
	other options include cluster installation and SQL Server update.
	Setup Role -> Default roles -> needed roles are preselected

	The DNS server is set manually to 193.203.198.8 and the secondary one to 8.8.8.8

	NB!!!
	The SQL Server 2012 Roles Wizard doesn't have a 'Finish' button.

Windows workstations

	We create an xs-software account on each Windows workstation.
	It usually has 'xs-administrator' as password.
	The actual Windows Administrator password isn't set or is left for the user to select one.
	When the xs-software password expiration approaches, we can change it to another one
	from the administrator account and then switch it back to xs-administrator

	The MS Office 2007 installation files and license can be found on the share server.
	The PC name usually contains the user's name.
	After installation we should run Driver Booster 3, found on the usb.

	\\shareserver\Public\original-office-2007
		Copy SW_CD_Office_2007_W32_English_-2_1_PA_BG_MLF_X16-19609 to desktop
		The licence archive is password protected. Both are removed after installing the MS Office
		from the desktop.

	\\shareserver\Public\kaspersky-setup
		After it's installed disable the policy, so that the user doesn't have access
		to Kasperski.
		setup.exe - agent for Windows 7
		kes10*.exe - agent for Windows 10

		Select from tray, right click and disable policy. This requires the password.
		You can find the password in password-gorilla.
		Protocols are prepared after setup is ready.

	Thunderbird/Mail client Setup:

Backup and Restore:

	Norton Ghost (depends on the hardware and drivers, it may break if backup is restored on different
				hardware)
	Macrium Reflect Free
	Acronis (it also fixes the Windows registers and sets the proper drivers, slower than Norton Ghost;
			preferred when restoring an image to different hardware because it sets up drivers)
			It can be downloaded as a bootable ISO image.
