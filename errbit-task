Commands

	  NB!!! Errbit is using Rails. bundle install should be run to install missing gems, as well as
	  the rake tasks found in the README.md
	  it also uses MongoDB
	  https://docs.mongodb.org/v2.4/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat-centos-or-fedora-linux/
	  https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/configure-linux-iptables-firewall/

	The vm_web box can be port-forwarded from the host machine. The Vagrant boxes can communicate
	with each other in the VirtualBox VLAN. This is why the vm_db doesn't have to be
	port forwarded.

	Getting started with configuration management (Digital Ocean tutorial):

   	Adding yum repository with Puppet:

	Errbit requires Ruby >= 2.1.0. Therefore RVM should be installed and run to install the newest
	Ruby.

	Web box:
	install curl and git
	add ruby-ng repo
	install newest Ruby with apt and ruby-switch
	install mongodb-clients
	install bundle

	git clone the errbit repository
	database is set in .env.default in the MONGO_URL environment variable (errbit is set
		entirely with environment variables. It is prefered that .env.default is
		copied to .env):
		mongodb://username:password@example.com:port
	run bundle and Rake tasks
		bundle install
		bundle exec rake errbit:bootstrap
		bundle exec rails server
	bundle exec rails server &> /dev/null &

	DB box:
	Add MongoDB repository
	Curl may also be needed to download the i686 built of Mongo and install it from tarball
	Install MongoDB
	Open port with iptables for MongoDB
	Enable text search: add setParameter=textSearchEnabled=true to /etc/mongodb.conf
	This feature is required by errbit. It is enabled by default since version 2.6 of MongoDB
	However, some builds of MongoDB may ship with older versions of it. Ubuntu 14.04 ships with MongoDB 2.4.9

	(probably) Create MnogoDB user
