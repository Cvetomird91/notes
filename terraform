Terraform CLI

terraform init - initializes the preresiquites for the tf objects in the current directory. Downloads
				 related plugins etc

terraform plan - dry run - it parses the tf files and shows what's about to be changed

	terraform plan -target resource_type.resource_logical_name - only plan a specific resource
	terraform plan -var-file=dmz.tfvars

terraform apply - applies the changes for the given tf files. If it was already run it doesn't spawn
				  new objects. If those tf files have changed since the last run it applies the
				  differences to the already created ones

	terraform apply --auto-approve - apply without being prompted
	terraform apply -var-file=dmz.tfvars
	terraform apply -var "subnet_prefix=10.0.1.5/24"

terraform show -  shows the current state of the objects declared by the tf files. Can be used
				  to retrieve AWS SSH public keys

terraform validate - validate the tf files' syntax

terraform destroy - destroy the objects created by terraform

	terraform destroy -target resource_type.resource_logical_name - destroys a specific resource
	terraform destroy -var-file=dmz.tfvars

terraform state - sync back and forth the current local and remote state

	terraform state pull - synchronize the local state with the remote one
	terraform state push <tfstate-file> - synchronize the remote state with the local one
	terraform state list - list all the current active resources
	terraform state show resource_type.resource_logical_name - show detailed information
							about the state of a resource

.terraform - this directory gets created to store needed plugins
terraform.tfstate	- terraform resource state. Terraform keeps track of the resources here
