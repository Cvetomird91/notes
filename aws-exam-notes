1 RCU - One strongly consistent read per second of 4KB.
In order to determine the number of RCUs for a number of reads per seconds we need to determine the
number of complete chunks
and then multiply the number of chunks with the count of complete reads.
E.g. to calculate the RCUs of 25 strongly consistent reads per seconds of 15 KB (those are 4 complete
chunks of 4KB - 4 x 4 = 16KB),
we need 25 x 4 = 100 RCUs

To calclulate eventually consistent reads we need to divide the final result by 2:
(25 x 4) / 2 = 50 RCUs

WCU - write capacity unit
1 WCU = 1 write per second of 1KB (1024 bytes). 
How to calculate for example for 100 writes per second of 512 bytes:
512 bytes uses one complete chunk of 1 KB
(512/1024 = 0.5, rounded up to 1).

Amazon RDS manages for the developer the following things out of the box:
- database software installation and patching
- hardware provisioning
- backups
You are still responsible for managing the database settings reuired by the application.

Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) - write-through caching service for DynamoDB.

Amazon Redshift - managed data warehouse solution

Amazon Neptune - NoSQL graph database for highly connected datasets.

ElastiCache for Memcached doesn't support a high-availability configuration.
Only ElastiCache Redis could run for in a high-availaiblity configuration.

In DynamoDB scans are less efficient than queries.
