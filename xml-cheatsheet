An XML document can have only one root node - there cannot be any siblings at the same level as the root node.

Attribute names are case sensitive.

Tag names are case sensitive.

Using UTF-8 or UTF-16 is advised. It can be specified at the XML declaration on the first line:

<?xml version="1.0"?>

References:

They allow us to include additional text or markup. They start with & and end with ;

- Entity references:

Entity References: An entity reference contains a name between the start and the end delimiters. For example &amp; where amp is name. The name refers to a predefined string of text and/or markup.

- Character References: These contain references, such as &#65;, contains a hash mark (“#”) followed by a number. The number always refers to the Unicode code of a character.

The document prolog starts at the beginning of the XML document. It contains the XML declaration and the document type declaration.

<?xml
   version="version_number"
   encoding="encoding_declaration" <!-- UTF-8 is default -->
   standalone="standalone_status"	<!-- yes or no, identifies wether outer sources will be included -->
?>

- CDATA

Nesting is not allowed in the CDATA section.
"]]>" cannot be contained anywhere in the XML.

<element xmlns:name="URL">

xmlns - XML Namespace

Some space characters are significant, other aren't. Spaces between XML attributes aren't significant.
