strategy: watch lectures at 1.5/2x speed. Take notes of new material. Mark lectures as complete
after each new information has been taken down. Revise notes regularly.

The lectures usually don't cover all of the needed information on a topic. Watching and learning
the new information off the lecture doesn't mean that I know all about the topic. They can be used
to provide a solid basis about those areas but they don't cover all the data.

Complete all the homeworks.
