UUIDs can be obtained with blkid or ls

	sudo blkid /dev/sda1
	ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid

		cvetomir@nintendo:~$ ls -l /dev/disk/
		total 0
		drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 260 Jun 19 19:02 by-id
		drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 160 Jun 19 19:02 by-path
		drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 100 Jun 19 19:02 by-uuid

UIDs and GIDs of a user can be obtained with id

	id - without arguments returns information about current user
	id cvetomir - returns information about user cvetomir

Available locales can be checked with the locale command:

	locale -a

	NB!!!
	A new line should be placed after the last line of /etc/fstab

-- FSTAB FIELDS

	file system
			block or remote filesystem to be mounted

	mount point

	type

		udf, iso9660 - for mounting iso images and CDs
		swap (the mountpoint should be also swap)
		vfat (also known as FAT32)
		ntfs - MS-DOS partition

	affs, autofs, cifs, coda, coherent, cramfs, debugfs, devpts, efs, ext, ext2, ext3, ext4,
	fat, hfs, hfsplus, hpfs, iso9660, jfs, minix, msdos, ncpfs, nfs, nfs4, ntfs, proc, qnx4,
	ramfs, reiserfs, romfs, squashfs, smbfs, sysv, tmpfs, ubifs, udf, ufs, umsdos, usbfs, vfat, xenix, xfs, xiafs,

	Sample options for mounting an NTFS partition:
	UUID=1816EFAA16EF86DA /media/winC ntfs nls-utf8,umask-0755,uid=1000,gid=1000,rw  	0 		0

	dump - legaxy journaling file system backup tool - 0 to disable, 1 to enable

	pass - file system check

			0 - do not check
			1 - check this partition first
			2 - check this partition next

-- OPTIONS

	default - use the default options. Those amount to:
	rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, async

	rw - read and write operations can be performed

	suid - permit the usage of SUID/SGID file permissions

	dev -

	exec - executables can be executed

	nouser - file system can be mounted only by root (default behavior)

	sync/async - chooses if changes should be writen synchronously to disk or not

		Synchronously means that the changes will be written to disk right after the command is issues
		Asynchronously means that the changes will be written before the disk is unmounted

	auto - file system will be mounted on boot (default behavior)

	ro - read-only file system

	noatime - disables tracking of access times

	nodiratime - disable changing of atime on directories

	strictatime - the atime is changed every time a file is accessed

	user - every user can mount the file system.
			This option also sets the following options, unless overriden:
									noexec, nosuid, nodev

	owner - allow the owner of the device to mount it

	!!!Permissions for ntfs and vfat file system should be set with the dmask, umask and fmask options
	dmask - controls permissions for directories
	fmask - controls permissions for files
	umask - controls permissions for both
		those permissions aren't set the usual way, but reverse to the default chmod options
		755 permissions should be set as 022

	permissions - you can use chmod/chown on the filesystem mount point
				  downside compared to masks is you have to use it each time the partition is mounted

	acl - enable Access Control Lists in case the filesystem supports them

	grpid - allows new files on the partition to have the parent directory's group id, not the groupd id of the
			process creatign it

	relatime - access time (atime) is modified only if they are earlier than the modification time (mtime)

	noauto - don't mount automatically (on boot or when mount -a is used)

	exec/noexec - executables can/can not be executed on the file system

	suid, nosuid - SUID, SGID permissions can/can not be set on a file from the filesystem

	uid=1000 - files are owned by user with uid 1000

	utf8

	locale - can be used to set a locale on the filesystem

	nobootwait

	nofail - the boot sequence will not continue if the mount of the device fails

	fg - mounting is performed as foreground task. The default setting is on

	bg - mounting is performed as background task if the first attempt fails. This is off by default

-- NFS, SMP, Cifs and FUSE

	port - specifies an alternative port for NFS (default is 2049)

	vers - specify NFS protocol version (version 3 is default)

-- mount command options

	-without arguments - list all current mounts (same as cat /etc/mtab)
		mount | column -t
	-t - type
	-o - options
		-o remount - remount file system
	-a - mount all
	-l -t ext4 - list all mounts of a specific type
	-n - mount without an entry in /etc/mtab

	mount /path/to/mount-point - mount an already described in /etc/fstab file system

	mount -M /path/to/mount-point /path/to/new/mount-point - change file system mount point

	mount a .iso Disk Image

		mount -t iso9660 -o loop pdf_collections.iso /mnt

	Bind mounts:

	mount all or part of already mounted file system to another location in the hierarchy

	mount --bind /media/storage /home/username/files

-- umount command options

	umount -f - force unmount
